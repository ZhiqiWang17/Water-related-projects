## Rainfall runoff modeling in NAM
The NAM is consider as a rainfall-runoff model to analyze the River Dender catchment in Belgium, Umax, CK12, TOF as the parameters to modify the accuracy of the model.
 
## Sewer system in VUB
Create SWMM model of the sewer system in campus, consider LID measures to solve the outflow problem.
SWMM software allows the user to build models of sewer systems by implementing junctions, conduits, rain gages, sub-catchments. LID is Low Impact Developments, such as permeable pavement, green roofs, aim to decrease the stormwater runoff. 

## Surface water modeling
Surface water modeling using SWAT+ software. This project set up a hydrological model for the study area and investigate the effects on the performance of the model, The model has components such as weather, surface runoff, lateral flow, precipitation, evapotranspiration. HRUs represent the areas with different features in terms of land use, soil and slope classes.

## Yangtze Delta eutrophiction
Applying the stakeholder analysis and DPSIR to evaute the river eutrophication status.
